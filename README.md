# Airline-Review-Health-and-Lifestyle-Analysis
This University Assingment consisted of two sections where in the first section we were made to analyse the customersâ€™ behaviour and their
preferences obtained through the airline holiday booking system using Python to identify the factors affecting customer choices, evaluating the influence of holiday booking time on customer behaviour, predict the likelihood of a successful holiday booking based on customer
characteristics and Investigate the popularity of various routes and flight schedules.

In section 2, as a Data Analyst for the R&D department of the "Sleeping Clinic" company, I successfully analyzed the health records of registered users. Using the "Health and Lifestyle" dataset containing anonymized data, I performed the following tasks using Tableau:

Charting Professions with Abnormal Blood Pressure:

Displayed a chart using the parameter function to show the most and least frequent professions with abnormal blood pressure.

Daily Steps by Occupation:

Created a chart to display the maximum and minimum daily steps for each occupation category, arranged in descending order.

Correlation Analysis:

Investigated the correlation between BMI, stress level, and blood pressure.

Physical Activity and Sleep Duration:

Explored the relationship between physical activity and sleep duration, demonstrating the connection to sleep disorders.

Interactive Dashboard:

Developed an interactive dashboard with at least four sheets, ensuring interactivity such that clicking on any dashboard sheet displays related information across all sheets.
